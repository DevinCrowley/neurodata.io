long_description: Layer 2/3 - Davi Bock, Ph.D. and Wei-Chung Allen Lee, Ph.D., in the laboratory of Clay Reid, M.D., Ph.D. acquired a beautiful volume of mouse primary visual cortical data, spanning layers 1, 2/3, and upper layer 4. In addition to the electron microscope (EM) data, they used two-photon microscopy to determine the functional properties of about 14 of the cells in the same volume. Images were collected at approximately 4x4x45 cubic nanometers with a total volume of approximately 450x350x50 cubic microns.
